</title><link/>http://djangocon.org/blog/2009/09/17/new-chairman/<description>

&lt;p&gt;The new Chairman of DjangoCon is James Tauber (http://jtauber.com/). He will be the Chairman for DjangoCon 2010 (a collaboration between Siu Design and the community) and 2011 (which will be a full community run conference). We'll be looking for additional volunteers to help out with next year's conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm very excited to have James on-board, he's a natural leader in my opinion and great things will come out of him being involved with the conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For 2010 I will still be in the background dealing with sales/contract/sponsorship/finance related things, and also helping with the transition process to get ...

&lt;p&gt;It's the last day of DjangoCon and it's been an interesting ride. With little time (especially after organising EuroDjangoCon) we managed to get everything together and everyone seems to have enjoyed themselves. There have been a few hiccups here and there but I really expected that to happen, especially as it's our first year on our own. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We're back next year in Portland again. The dates will probably be the same, but we're going to have tutorials before the conference, then the main conference and then the sprints. If you want to register for it you should be able ...

</title><link/>http://djangocon.org/blog/2009/09/01/tickets-djangocon-have-sold-out/<description>

&lt;p&gt;Tickets for this years DjangoCon have sold out. If you would like to be put on a waiting list in case anyone cancels please mail me via the contact form in the contact section. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those wondering, we always have a cap in place to make it easier to budget. It looked like this year would be a difficult year for conferences, so we budgeted for a lower amount. Next year we might increase the attendance level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To help some of you in future I'll put a notification system in place so that if there are fewer than ...

</title><link/>http://djangocon.org/blog/2009/08/11/djangocon-schedule/<description>

&lt;p&gt;We've released the schedule at &lt;a href="http://www.djangocon.org/2009/conference/schedule/"&gt;http://www.djangocon.org/2009/conference/schedule/&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great line-up and I'm really looking forward to it. When I get around to it this evening I will push some more changes so you can get more information on the talks and speakers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those of you who haven't heard back, that doesn't necessarily mean your talk has been rejected. There are still a few slots I'm going to add and I will get back to everyone by tomorrow evening at the latest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, go ahead and register at &lt;a href="http://djangocon09.eventbrite.com"&gt;http://djangocon09.eventbrite.com&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DjangoCon is going to rock! &lt;/p&gt;
